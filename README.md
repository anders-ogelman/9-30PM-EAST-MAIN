# 9-30PM-EAST-MAIN
This is the Tidalcycles source code and sound library for the album "9:30 PM, East Main", an album I released last year. It was produced entirely in Tidalcycles, with the exception of a short bit of synthesizer at the start of the first track, which I made using a Roland SP404sx.
